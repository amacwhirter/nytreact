Georgia Tech Week 19 - MERN Stack

 ```
React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This assignment requires
you to create React components, work with helper functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle 
to query and display articles based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so 
that users can save articles to read later.
